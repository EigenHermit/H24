This compilation presents two comprehensive tables derived from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset:
## Table 1: System Overview
This table encompasses 272 (candidate) systems, including previously identified lenses. It provides a concise summary of each potential lensed quasar system.
## Table 2: Detailed Information
The second table offers in-depth data for each system listed in Table 1.
