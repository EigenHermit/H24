# Catalogs of KiDS Lensed QSO Candidates from KiDS DR5 Dataset
This compilation presents two comprehensive tables derived from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset:
## Lensed QSOs in KiDS DR5 (Table3).csv: System Overview
This table encompasses 272 (candidate) systems, including previously identified lenses. It provides a concise summary of each potential lensed quasar system.
## Table 4.csv: Detailed Information
The second table offers in-depth data for each system listed in Lensed QSOs in KiDS DR5 (Table3).csv 
## Paper title: Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Search for Strongly Lensed Quasar in KiDS DR5
