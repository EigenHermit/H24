# Catalogs of KiDS Lensed QSO Candidates from KiDS DR5 Dataset
This compilation presents two comprehensive tables derived from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset:
## Table 1: System Overview
This table encompasses 272 (candidate) systems, including previously identified lenses. It provides a concise summary of each potential lensed quasar system.
## Table 2: Detailed Imagery
The second table offers in-depth visual data for each system listed in Table 1. It contains high-resolution images that allow for detailed examination of the candidate lensed quasar systems.
These catalogs serve as a valuable resource for researchers studying gravitational lensing and quasar populations in the KiDS survey area.
